Stewart also included some revival songs for his version of When I need You ( Leo Sayer ) and Sometimes When We Touch ( Dan Hill ) , which are also sensational . The rest are standard songs that can be found in his other albums especially in his Storyteller collection , which I also have .

The idea of teaching kids that sometimes we can not control the situation that angers us is good , but again , the example ( I think one in which a favorite team loses a game ) was not great .

Yet I will add that is for more a mature audience , w or some sexual notations .. this book is wonderful and will have me reading more books in the future ."}

I realize that Wainwright is classically trained , but the songs seem discordant , with disharmonius arrangements and queasy melodies . If Wainwright intended to apply a more modern school of composition to traditional pop songs , the mix simply does not work .

I had no objection to the series deviation from history ; I object to its weak storytelling , bad acting , and total lack of imagination ! Poor sets ( they only put thought into the clothing ) , virtually no battles , and the sensibilities of a soap opera make this series vacuous and painfully bad .

This recording has them in an altogether different setting playing off one and other strengths in a series of standard duets . While both are past peak performance-wise by this mid-70 s recording date , there is no real evidence of a lack of power or virtuosity and the solos on each cut are inventive and technically interesting . The material is well-chosen , mostly standard ballads but both Edison and Peterson background in blues-laden swing comes through loud and clear . Highly recommended ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "The authors explain in the introduction that but for commercial constraints they could have made a much larger book , in fact a book of each chapter . This is precisely the wrong way to think about any kind of creative work . Creation is SELECTION . Anyone can gather facts and factoids ( or as Lou Harrison might say , facticles ) and make a great pile of them . It is quite another thing to forge them into a clear , compelling narrative line , and this other thing is just what the authors fail to accomplish . It is safe to assume , I think , that a Lou Harrison autobiography would be much , much , much better than this ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "Tanenbaum brilliantly examines how being called a slut has nothing to do with sexual activity . It is the chosen insult of those who see a woman stepping out of her presumed role : be it beauty , culture , dating , etc . A woman can go out on multiple dates and be branded a slut , or can be a virgin who does not dress appropriately but is disliked by others and therefore is branded a slut for convenience . Tanenbaum brings in important examples such as the Spur Possee and the Glen Ridge , NJ rape of a mentally retarded girl to explores how assumptions about masculinity and femininity feed this process . When people think calling someone a slut is harmless they are wrong . However , she makes it clear that none of the women who stories she tells are victims , they triumped !"}

The drums and percussion on all the groundbreaking 1970 s Moroder or Bellotte recordings was provided by drummer Keith Forsey or through the use of Moog synthesizer modules .

{"label": "2", "text": "Perhaps it is not so surprising that so many other reviewers here trash this really memorable and well-done indie flick . This is a movie made by a gay filmmaker for a gay audience , and it is a rather clever and insightful satire that works -- and is really funny to boot . As one earlier reviewer indicated , when someone holds a mirror up to you and you do not like what you see , many tend to criticize the person holding the mirror -- not the reflection . This is a film that holds a mirror up to the shallowness , superficiality , and vapidity of the `` gay ghetto , '' and it is no wonder that lots of people do not like it and because it makes them uncomfortable , they shoot the messenger . I think it works on every level . Sure , some of the acting is bad , but folks , this is a SATIRE and that is part of how you get satire across . I congratulate Wally White on a job well done !"}

{"label": "2", "text": "Well , 142 people have written reviews for this CD already , but I will add my 2 cents . I will agree with the many reviewers who wished it had included every Hot 100 chart single . However , in my opinion it is the best to date and much preferable than `` Big Ones '' . All of the late 80 s and beyond hits are here , which is mostly what I am looking for . Most of the big hits from the 70 s are also here . What missing are `` Home Tonight '' , `` Kings and Queens '' , `` Come Together '' , `` Chip Away the Stone '' , and `` Remember ( Walking in the Sand ) '' . I suppose if I just ca not live without those songs , I can try to download them . Anyway , a good CD with a lot of great tunes ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "I was very disappointed while reading this Kindle Novel . As an avid Amish Fiction reader , this book contained language and sexual contens that was degrading the Amish People . The Amish books that I enjoy reading contains scriptures and God related passage . This is not that kind of book . I will not be reading anymore of Annette Blair novels ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "I purchased this to be given as a gift in conjunction with some other items . When it arrived , the packaging was open and had been sloppily retaped with brown packing tape , so I had to find something else to add to my gift basket . I then proceeded to open it up to give to my daughter to play with , and discovered one piece of chalk was already broken . When she tried using these on her chalkboard , they continually broke as she was using them . Also , the colors are just printed on the outside , they are not actually multicolored chalk . Overall one of the worst things I have ever bought - I did not expect much for the price , but they were not even functional . The Crayola sidewalk chalk we use outdoors on the driveway is much sturdier and has survived drops , throwing , and numerous bumpy trips in my daughter wagon ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "Part of me thinks it is unfair to review a book I could not finish , but not when I really want to warn other people off ! I have tried twice to read it , but both times could not get past about page 30.The writing is flat , the characters cardboard , and there is way too much purple prose . Diana `` ginger-colored curls '' are mentioned three times in the first chapter ; I GET it already ! Also , I think it is kind of gratuitous to have sexual abuse of a character before that character been brought alive to the reader ; it is as if the author trying to use sensationalism in place of character , plotting and a lot else . Do not buy this book ."}
{"label": "2", "text": "I would probably put this album above `` Steal This Album , '' below `` Toxicity , '' and tied with `` System of a Down . '' There is not a single forgettable song on this disc , be it the ( what a local D.J . called ) `` thrash-polka '' vibe of `` Radio or Video '' or the mournful sound of the last track , `` Lost in Hollywood . '' Unfortunately , it seems as if the lyrics on this disc have taken the backburner to this music . Less of the lyrical evolution can be seen on this disc as opposed to System earlier material , but they more than compensate for this with the complex riffing and song structure . I would highly recommend this album , if only for `` This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I am On This Song . ''"}
{"label": "2", "text": "Not ever having experienced a debilitating disease , this book places the reader in the midst of the chaos and heartbreak that is breast cancer . Several times throughout I had to set the book aside and continue reading it later -- It was simply too much to handle.I applaud Mr. Brown on being able to share so candidly what he experienced . It is one thing listening to a televised interview of of breast cancer patients or survivors -- but television does not allow the time OR cover the depth of what REALLY goes on.Reading this journal truly opened my eyes and opened up discussions between me and my husband on what we would do if we were faced with this situation . I recommend this book to all people ... ESPECIALLY those of us that have been spared such a terrible tragedy ."}
{"label": "2", "text": "This is what fantasy is supposed to be . Not Harry Potter , not the Hobbit , but hard-hitting , with a realistic storyline . Eddings does an excellent job of developing the politics of the land , an item often overlooked in fantasy writting . He also makes the characters deep and sincere , not two-dimensional as is so often the case . Magic is present , but is not the primary focus and the scenes of warfare are unmatched in modern fantasy writing.These books differ greatly from the Belgariad . If you liked that series , you will not necessarily enjoy this one , although I loved both . I always look forward to Edding next book and I hope he will soon return to the land where I began my adventure all those years ago ."}
{"label": "2", "text": "This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read . I have read it a few times and always find it fascinating . Whether all of these stories of Henri Charriere ( `` Papillon '' ) are true , I do not know . I only know he is one heckuva storyteller.The amount of ups-and-downs in Charriere years of imprisonment and escapes are just mind-boggling . Told in the first-person narrative , `` Papi '' tells it all simply and colorfully.If you are seeking a great adventure book , you ca not wrong with this ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "This is a Televsion broadcast DVD . The 90 minute special from 1959 has some interesting things although the Kodak commercials get annoying . It is also very slow and somewhat boring especially during parade coverage and such . Some of the stuff on this disk is found on other Disney Treasures releases . It you have to collect them all then by all means buy it , but if you just want the best then buy Secrets , Stories and Magic . I still like this one , but I was just let down that it was not as good as the other Treasures releases ."}
