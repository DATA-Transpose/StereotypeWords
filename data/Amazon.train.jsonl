This toaster does everything ! The glass door does slam shut if it is not opened all the way which can be frustrating at times but overall this product is a must have ! After 7 years , 5 moves across the country , and getting used almost everyday , ours died the other day ... the heating elements wo not heat up anymore . We went to a few stores to look at toaster ovens and found nothing that jumped out at us . We wanted the same toaster again so here we are buying number two ! We highly recommended it !"}

A really bad attempt of turning Xena into a tomb raider clone , levels that are bugged fights that are uninvolving and just a whole game engine that does not work !

If you throw the chacram you go into a pov situated behind and control it ! meaning that you can hit out of the way switches , close drawbridges and kill enemies with the cleanest of ease.However despite this it does not stop the game from being terrible !

Rubsam , by comparison plods through this great work with an uninspired registry that fails to bring out the greatness of this work of Bach ."}

Kay offers a sophisticated critique of the assumption that markets can , on their own , guarantee prosperity , and he shows how culture and institutions play a crucial role in driving economic growth . At the same time , he rejects facile attacks on capitalism , arguing convincingly that markets remain the most powerful engine of prosperity ever invented.Kay style is generally quite readable , but at times here -- more so than in his FT work -- he gets bogged down in theory and detail , and there are ponderous passages to wade through . On the whole , though , this is illuminating stuff , and anyone interested in understanding why some parts of the world are rich while others are poor should take a look ."}

He talks of his inattention to duty on anti-submarine patrol which would endanger those in the fleet he should have been protecting .

Either one would be an immense task , but both is really impressive.Moving Shakespeare from the stage to the screen while preserving the integrity of the play has become something of a specialty of Branagh since . Oddly , though , none of his later efforts has had quite the appeal of Henry V. `` Othello '' is close , but the rest tend to be cumbersome and way too ambitious . See also : `` Hamlet '' You are going to have to let go of some cynicism to really enjoy this . His performance of the `` Saint Crispin Day '' monologue has become something of a trademark for him , but it is a little overly sincere . Most of the film avoids this kind of forced intensity , but the speech is a notable exception . In fact , Branagh greatest contribution to the film is his directing , not his acting.Even if you do not already enjoy Shakespeare , you should give this film a try . It may change your mind .

Carly Simon understands these songs -- her take on `` I Get Along Without You Very Well '' is quiet and heartbreaking -- and she infuses this collection with a few contemporary and original songs . `` What Shall We Do with the Child '' ( which she co-wrote ) and `` From the Heart '' ( hers , entirely ) fit in beautifully with the older tunes . She breathed life into all of these songs ; she did not present them as if they were old standards . Her version of `` Not a Day Goes By '' concludes the record , and it could not be more perfect . This album is more satisfying than the enjoyable My Romance ( 1990 ? ) because it feels fresh and new and not the slightest bit reverential . I wish Carly Simon got more credit for being the first major star of her generation to sing these songs again . That is why I am writing this review ."}

It paints a very balanced portrait of Bird . I like the fact that it is not slanted one way or the other . It portrays the good and the bad . I am a Bird fan , but I like objective journalism , which this seems to be . No schlock hero worship journalism here , nor is there any railing against him . Even though I like Bird , I will not condone his actions if they are perceived as wrong or controversial ."}

Bossa Nova was revolutionary and Jobim a geniusand I hope he is inducted into the Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame soon , as one of the most brilliant of all composers of the 20th century . This CD is essential for all of us who love Bossa Nova and know it well . A word of caution , however , for our younger music lovers . Do not mischaracterize Bossa Nova based on this CD . This orchestratral approach became the basis for much or all of Muzak . And like so much of radical brilliance , became cliche would . Every businessman who has travelled has also heard these arrangements in Holiday Inn bars all over the US , listen to `` Girl from Ipanema '' and mourn the passage of time . Some of the beautiful flute `` improvisations '' , actually simple harmonies , are the basis for some of the most bland smooth so-called jazz today .

For example , I believe it was Casca : The Warlord where he was buiried alive and went into a sort of deep sleep . Another book where he got trapped in an underground river and was only awake when his body surfaced in areas with air pockets . So , while the parts about him waiting for a fish to swim close enough for him to catch and eat were mildly interesting , it really has no continuity with other events in the overall story line .

The director and producers took some of my favorite actors and left me not caring if they lived or died . The actors really did try to do something with the parts , but even they could not save this one . On the commentary the director compares the film to Alien , which is where he got most of his ideas from , but what he forgot when making his movie was that Ridley Scott made his characters come to life and there was even a fair amount of humor , plus fantastic sets , awesome models , great music , and a really good story . As far as I am concerned , Howard the Duck is a far better movie than Event Horizon . I am donating my copy of this movie to the trash ."}

I also loved the banter between them . The cast is great.Favorite scenes : The scene after the fire between Jane and Mr. Rochester , the proposal scene , the scene when Jane is on the moors praying `` our Father who art in Heaven '' , and the scene when Jane returns to Edward.I truly enjoyed it ; very well done ."}

Stewart is horribly cast in the lead , incapable of showing any more expression than her usual sullenness , and can not act even if her life depended on it . The movie would have benefitted from a director who knew what he was doing , a better crafted story that was not trying to pander to the audience coming to see the leading lady , and a leading actress capable of emotional range . Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron , who are much better than the material deserves , should be in a better movie .

There were a few instances of kissing ( one while rolling on the grass ) while his girlfriend was kept in the dark.I do not know about other readers , but I ca not admire a hero who cheats on his girlfriend , or a heroine who steals a man from another woman.I have another book by Spencer waiting for me to read , and I do not know if I will bother ."}

It does not fit my kids very well for whatever reason .... they are both long-waisted though , so maybe that is why . We have had a lot of trouble getting the base to remain `` safe '' in the car . Also , the straps are a little hard to adjust- I have gotten better at it with all the practice from two kids , but still .... The stroller is also big and bulky , although I love the storage it has , and it has held up pretty well ( we have not been gentle to it ! ) overall . But yes , the carseat is not so great .

{"label": "2", "text": "My son was five weeks early . Giving him my breastmilk was very important to me . He had a poor latch and a worse suck , so I pumped and gave him a bottle . Everyday I would try him first at my breast then give him the bottle . For six weeks I did this . It was exhausting and I was ready to give up . At my baby shower someone gave me the contact nipple shield as a gift . He was old enough to have a good suck . In three days he went from bottle to shield to breast only . It was exactly what he needed to make the transition.All that said , this should NOT be the first thing you use with your infant . A good lactation consultant will tell you to work with your healthy , term infant for good latch and suck . Giving advice such as expressing a little milk before putting baby on , so that the breast is not so engorged that it is impossible for baby to latch ; would be a great place to start .

Assuming your computer or audio interface device has an input and output , the surest way to record the audio stream as well as to monitor it is to run a `` patch '' cord between the two inputs and to use the open female end for connection to a speaker or headphone.This one does the job just fine and at little expense ."}

I can not think of a role either actor would be suited for . It is not even worth a review -- think of this as a warning to your entertainment welfare.The writing for this movie was just awful .

{"label": "2", "text": "This is a book in the Reformation Trail series . It takes place during the period of Wycliffe growing influence upon the English population.This is the story of two young people caught in the struggle to bring the Bible to the English people . In the background is John Wycliffe whose influence changed the lives of those whom he taught . Herbert Ellerdale was one of the men influenced by Wycliffe who feeling called to the priesthood felt that many of the teachings of the church were wrong . Central to the story is the struggle to free the church from the chains placed upon it , the account also reminds the reader how far we have come in giving dignity to the poor and the laboring classes . The story challenges the reader to ask himself if he could be true to the faith if faced with death unless he recanted ."}

Sadly , this feature stopped working after roughly 8 months of use.When I called HP to claim a warranty repair , I was transferred to a service agent in another country . After 20 minutes of repeating and correcting serial numbers or model numbers I was told that this monitor was not in their database and therefore I could not be helped . What the heck ! I offered to email pictures of the model number sticker , fax copies of the invoice , etc . All to no avail , the `` service '' representative declined my request to speak with a manager to resolve the issue .

We initially had some great tug of war and fetch going on and she really loved it . She lost interest ( as a puppy will ) and I left the toy on the floor . I came back about a half-hour later to discover she would chewed through the middle and had ripped out all the stuffing.People may have different experiences as she is a bit of a destroyer . She even managed to destroy one of the KONG . Dental Dog toys and one of the KONG Frisbees.If anyone else has similar destroyers I can only recommend the original KONG . 10 months of continues play , including cage time , it only shows a couple teeth mark here and there ."}

Listening to all six symphonies , you will have a definite sense of déjà vu , but if you listen to a couple at a time , you will be struck by the spontaneity and enthusiasm of these little pieces and enjoy the special coloration that Benda writing for the horns gives them .

There are ( regrettably ) few high-volume energetic tunes like `` Since U Been Gone '' on this album , with most of the songs being soft and relatively too simple . One of the exceptions is the hit `` Miss Independent '' , the best track in my opinion . This tune has a unique background beat , soulful lyrics , and a loud , majestic chorus . It would seem that this debut album features a completely different side of Kelly than is on Breakaway , preferably the less desirable side . I would not recommend this album also because it is not satisfyingly intricate , and has few likeable tracks.I recommend : Miss IndependentLowBeautiful DisasterYou Thought Wrong"}

{"label": "2", "text": "I picked up this game for $ 4 at a used videogame store , not expecting that much , considering it was less than it would have cost me to rent a game at blockbusters .

The game play involves keeping up a tempo , while pointing directions with the directional pad from time to time and controling the volume , arguably the most frusterating in my mind . The balance between forte and piano is very delicate.It would be a great game for children , with a complete lack of violence and of course the added bonus of the cultural aspect of classical music.The only downpoints I can find are : 1 ) This game can be HORRIBLY frusterating , I doubt you will get through without have to replay multiple concerts . 2 ) The graphics compared to nowadays seem a little outdated . On the other hand , graphics shouldnt be so much of a concern , considering how completely fun it is ."}

But guess what there are other R and B ladies out there well deserving of all the adjectives you all bestowed on Joss Stone . Do not get too hyped , as if she the next best thing to sliced bread , simple because she is British , white and 16 . Try listening to Vivian Green , Rhian Benson , Lizz Wright , Heather Headley , Ms. Abenna , and you will see Joss Stone ai not nothing special in the R and B arena ... NOT EVEN CLOSE on this CD ...

My attention was not due solely to the subject matters obvious humor ( including the interesting clash of stereo-types ) but because of Irena quietly persistent and dignified manner in seeing her idea through until her financial goal was achieved at which time her grandson then had a real shot at being cured of cancer . Faithfull truly acted the part and the story lines never let her down nor diminished her in stature despite the obvious attempt of others to do so once the true nature of her work was revealed .

Also fits an adult ( water goes above waist level ) with the kids . Great tool for cooling off and outdoor fun , and for teaching little ones to take turns and share . The pool is very simple to inflate , as each of the rings has a separate valve . The bottom is flat plastic , so this pool should either go on top of soft grass or a cushioned mat of some kind . The only time we have had to use part of the patch that was included was when my husband decided to jump in the pool . The patch job has held up great so far !"}

All his films are very violent . `` Payback '' , `` The Patriot '' and `` The Passion of Christ '' ( which at least I found to be pretty funny though I do not think it was meant to be ) all glorify violence.Catherine McCormack takes off her clothes in this film which is why I give it 1 star and not 0 . Unfortunately Sophie Marceau does not take off her clothes and even more unfortunate is that Mel does . I found the mooning scene in this movie to be quite childishThis movie is intended for the less intelligent American market rather than for us Scots . All of Mel Gibsons recent films are marketed towards less intelligent people such as George W Bush or the Pope or Mel himself I suppose.Mel Gibson has not made a decent film since `` Mad Max 2 '' yet he continues to make millions of dollars making these awful films.I guess ...

'' I did not find them warming -- I found them depressing . Why would it be heart-warming to hear a daughter telling her mother : `` You can poison your own lives if you want to -- just leave me out of it . You were adults long before any of us , and Annie and Pat are not even that yet , but we have grown up tainted by you at every turn '' ?

The less tonal works are hard to digest all at once , but if you have an ear for atonality , you should enjoy the middle tracks , particularly the Leef , Xenakis , Foss , and Husa . The final Duet for violins and string orchestra was my first exposure to a composition by Steven Reich other than his Music for Eighteen Musicians .

How , then , could such a wise man have such wrong notions about women . Among other foolish notions , he said that women are less spirited than men and are similar to eunuchs . Robert Mayhew explains that despite his intellect Aristotle was affected by the views of his age and although he conducted experiments before making pronouncements , his tools were inferior . Furthermore , despite his protestations , he relied on too much speculation . The book is valuable not only in showing us the history of concepts about women , but to warn people living today that they too are frequently making foolish and harmful mistakes based on improper evidence ."}

You may want to consider the VA702B instead and use good external speakers if sound quality is important to you ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "I am happy with other Black and Decker cordless tools I have purchased through Amazon.com ( and I love Amazon.com ) , so I ordered this cordless saw . Unfortunately , this saw would run for only a very short period of time ( 10 minutes ? ) -- and took hours to re-charge . I ended up sending it back and buying ( again , from my favorite online store - Amazon.com ) a saw with a cord -- the Bosch Model 1640VS `` Finecut '' saw . It was much more expensive , and for some folks it might not be as useful as a cordless reciprocating saw , and the blades are not cheap -- but I am hopeful the Bosch will take care of my needs ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "Considering this book , one must understand it was printed in 1983 and tell-all stories were not quite so `` in your face '' as they can be now . I did expect , and still would like to hear more about the actual autopsies in more detail , as it is barely discussed in this book . However , it is still an interesting accounting of controversial deaths , but will not answer those troubling questions most of us still debate . I found the first chapter about Natalie Wood to be the most enlightening . She really fought for her life , but still no one has satisfied the original question of why she tried to leave the boat in the first place . I must admit that he did more to elevate the status of forensics than any other individual in his field . Maybe Dr. Noguchi will do a more in depth book in the future and concentrate more on the cases than his troubled political life ."}

I did not realize it , because this looks like a legitimate product page ... but the wiring came loose and never felt quite comfortable . I am aggressive with my earphones , and since I thought I had a warranty on them after buying them on Amazon , I went to the Bang and Olufsen store in Manhattan . They looked at it , and told me my warranty was void since they were knockoffs , and they do not accept receipts from Amazon . If you want to try these out , please go to the actual B and O store and buy them there . Then if you do not like them you can return them ( I think within 30 days ) . Do not take your chances buying them off Amazon . ( Since then I went to a Bose store and I am very happy with my * real * headphones ) ."}

The other is a traditional Confucian morality steeped in centuries of lore.Kendall studies this through the ingenious choice of marriages . Here , the Confucian traditions often appear in the form of arranged marriages . Yet she shows how young couples persistently try to sidestep this format.Along the way , a non-Korean reader is also rewarded by many insights into Korean society . Things that an outsider who does not speak the language would simply miss ."}

In fact the first 16 chapters ( out of 34 ) are a course in the mathematical tools required to understand the rest . Even though he claims you could skip the equations and just read the words , I disagree - you would undertstand less than 10 % of it . I am at Chapter 8 ( `` Riemann Surfaces and Complex Mappings '' ) and I comprehend about 50 % ( I am a retired physicist ! ) .

While not the most romantic pair ever to have graced the planet , they are the archtypical strong macho characters needed for this novel to be taken seriously by the reader .

Responsible doctors do not let manic-depressive patients stay on Prozac alone . Sometimes they will simply change the prescription . Not everyone who takes prozac is violent . Not everyone who takes prozac is euphoric . Some people who take it simply become less ill with crippling disorders like depression and OCD .

Sometimes it does not register the new key press , and sometimes it pulses it very slowly as if you keep pressing it over and over , but are not holding them down . Occasionally the device resets the keyboard as well . This makes the lights flash and then go out for the lock indicators , but does not otherwise seem to cause problems .

The temperature never registered correctly . The steak was well done by the time the arrow started to move on the thermometer at all . I never used the others for pork or chicken ; I threw both sets of thermometers out . Yes , I had to buy 2 sets in order to be able to have enough for 4 steaks .

The ability of Roman Catholics to treat the Word of God with utter contempt by contorting the true and blatantly obvious meaning of Biblical passages to support their medieval error is beyond common sense and respectability . To read a brief yet true account of who Mary was ( is it not the truth that is important ) then read Doctor James White `` Mary , Another Redeemer ?

They do ( the good ones do ) deal with morality and social ethics . The `` demythologizing '' of the westerns have taken away one movie vehicle for actually talking about what `` right '' and what `` wrong . `` ( The one glaring `` sin '' of westerns was the disquieting and frequently disgusting treatment of Native Americans . But I would have preferred addressing that sin rather than throwing westerns out the window ) In this movie , the question of friendship is explored . And also the question of revenge .

The series is catagorized as mystery becuase there is some kind of unexplained murder in every book . Generally , Qwill is involved in solving them , while Koko provides invaluable assistance with his superior cat insticts . In this book , the murder is entirely periphial to the plot , and Qwill only real connection to it is that Koko yowls when it occoured . Otherwise , this might be any of a number of poor Mitford knock-offs , where the interst is supposed to come from the characters , but the characters are so dull that the story is not worth reading .

{"label": "1", "text": "I was greatly disappointed with this book . It is poorly organized , and unclear . It takes an application that should be learned fairly easily and makes it that much harder.When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing , the author lists them in a numbered list which leads you to believe there are mulitple steps involved . Here is one example : '' Creating a New Window '' '' To create a new window , you perform the following steps : 1 . Select File , New , Window . 2 . Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab . 3 . Select File , Project Settings . Select the Windows tab and then click New . `` These are listed as 3 steps , but in fact are just 3 different ways of doing the same thing.This is just one illustration of poor organization within this entire book ."}

Secondly , the book deals with how traditional baseball has resisted the use of statistics to make teams more efficent . Finally , the book is a quasi-biography of how Billy Beane attempted to implement all the above .

( For example , the barrels on the seal of New York City are not there because barrel-making was such a hot industry in the city ; they are there to represent flour milling . And there were not 500 brothels in the Five Points in the 1850s . These are just two of MANY questionable entries . ) On the other hand , in the section of `` Urban Myths , '' stories that are definitely true ( such as the finding once of a small caiman [ an alligator-like creature ] in Central Park ) are presented as tall tales.The book is highly disorganized and seems to have zero fact checkers .

{"label": "1", "text": "Ramsey Lewis ability to endure as a popular recording artist for nearly a half-century is due largely to sensitivity he has developed as to what kind of album stands the best chance for commercial success.Unfortunately , URBAN RENEWAL , released in 1989 , draws upon this sensitivity in a manner that has more to do with popularity than artistry . When he sticks to jazz , Lewis is among the best , but his commercial successes too often tempt him out of the jazz genre . So when he strays too far outside jazz in the interest of making a hit album , the quality of jazz often suffers . Of the nine tracks on URBAN RENEWAL , by my definition , only two -- Berniece and Love Song -- qualify as jazz . The rest is what was in vogue around 1989.I have enjoyed hearing Ramsey live in many venues and own most of his recordings . He has produced many of my favorites . URBAN RENEWAL is not one of them .

Second , the characters are forgettable . I would use more damning language , but they are not worth it .. just forgettable . There is no defining characteristic , ZERO personality , and no life . So , it is a tremendously well written book , but a complete waste of time ."}

Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is a perfectly good forward with a decent record for both Leeds and Chelsea , for whom at the time of writing he had scored 9 goals this season ( including a hat-trick against Wolves last weekend ) .True , the Dutchman has been left out of Holland provisional Euro 2004 squad , and may not have the most creative or well-executed goal celebrations in the league , but I do not think times are so hard that he is had to record an album , despite Hot Shot City being a particularly good track ."}

The danger is , in enclosed spaces such as cottages , tents , recreational vehicles and campers , any of these devices ( whether they run on propane , naphtha , kerosene ... ) can also quickly produce dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide when starved of oxygen.That is why this heater features a low oxygen shutoff system that automatically shuts the heater off if the amount of oxygen in the air gets too low .

We both already have the whole bean coffee and grinder so we could use it now for either our 12-pot coffeemakers or our One-cup coffermakers . And we did not have to get the special pods that other single-cup coffeemakers typically use . We did purchase the Size # 1 filters ; they cost about $ 1.80 for a box of 40 . This coffeemaker is so easy to use and we are both really glad we got them . The automatic shutoff is perfect especially for my mom since she is older and tends to forget to turn off things ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "* Dry Your Eyes * , the 1967 debut album from Philadelphia Brenda and The Tabulations , is not the most stylistically innovative music of that brief period where the difficulties inherent in being the world kindly manager appeared to be solving themselves and difficulties intrinsic to the US often evaporated instantaneously in a nimbus of `` modernist '' sentiment -- this is the sound of the period before the Detroit and Newark riots scarred civic sentiment , but in my estimation it is something like the distillation of the young working woman attitudes towards life in the urban United States . Brenda Payton encapsulates the `` ethos '' of that era clerk , teller , cashier or operator in love with the possibilities of the city : but if the romance seems a little expansive to the contemporary ear , perhaps it was not entirely a good idea to not heed such sentiments as these . A truly enduring cultural artifact ."}

To his credit , he has come up with a set of beats that are a little more modern than the last record , but the first reviewer was correct , too many ballads here .

The book mentions problem such problems as lack of counseling , education or what happens on parole - but spends far too little time on these topics .

{"label": "1", "text": "I do not know about everyone else , but it seems that this series just keeps getting worse . This is by far the worst book in the series , and there are several reasons for that.The first is the scare factor . Like The other two sequels , and unlike the origanal , this book fails to be scary . It just does not have any erie moments . Also , unlike the other books in this series , this one failed to entertain me altogether . The concept , as well as the characters , is bland.Another factor is credibility . I mean , how many terribly bad baby-sitting jobs can one have . My opinion is by the fourth book in the series , you need a new main character.This book seemed to be quickly thrown together to cash in on the baby-sitter series . This is not the best of Stine novels , and is by far the worst of the Baby-sitter novels ."}

Sir Peter seemed a little weak to me I guess it is because he really did not get his fair share of attention .

In my opinion I really think too much attention was being spent on the description of the scenery and other non-important character than on the main characters themselves .

God is real , and people can get real strength from Him , but telling your kids Santa is real is lying.Yes , yes , I know this is just a movie , and you are not expected to believe it . But the whole culture of lying to kids that Santa is real is just reinforced by it ."}

The only catch for me was that on my initial recordings the playback was great but when I replayed the recordings they were terrible . Windows had the Audio recording source as my Webcam and what was recorded was the sound coming out of the speakers being picked up by the Webcam . Once that was corrected via Windows Control Panel - > Sounds and Audio Devices - > Audio tab - > Sound Recording ( Default Device ) the recordings were great . I have not even bothered running any filters to take out the hiss yet as it is pretty insignificant.You have to set the input recording level before starting to record but that is a minor setup that will avoid problems later.The turntable itself is simple to set up and use . Not the greatest turntable ever but at the price it is a complete steal.I now get to listen to all my old albums on my IPod and am delighted with the purchase ."}

The backdrop for the story is the yearly Army-Navy game and what that game meant to these young men and others like them who had attended the service academies before them . The juxtaposition of world events leading up to WWII and culminating with these four men , and many of their classmates experiences during the war , makes this an interesting read for any WWII buff . These men had to finish their college careers in three years so that they could be rushed off to war and none of them shirked their responsibilities .

Your first beer , your first cigarette , how you view yoru parents and the immediate world that surrounds you.However , the book lacks plot . There is no climax , no intricate story , just a time slice of a young man life.The difficulty in this book is its rhythm .

Much of the prose I found rather obtuse , such as the following definition of multimedia : `` Basically , multimedia is nothing more than a unified programming and operating system ( OS ) environment that lets multiple forms of program data and playback media coexist and be routed directly to the appropriate hardware device for output , playback , and or or processing .

{"label": "2", "text": "The key to enjoying this film is to remember that it is not a documentary but a rendering of a fictional last performance of the radio program , but that is hard to remember when Garrison Keillor plays himself -- singing , telling stories , and peddling make believe commercials with dead pan seriousness . The live radio variety show that many people enjoyed is one thing ; this film loosely based upon it is another . Without that connection this film would never stand on its own . After thirty years the Soderbergs sold the building to wealthy Texans , and thus the show final act . The two Johnson sisters , Yolanda and Rhonda ( played by Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin ) , reminisce backstage while the show plays live in the background . Country cowboys Dusty and Lefty yuck it up . A woman who is really an angel , a death backstage during the broadcast , and a visit by one of the new investors disrupt the story line .

But , I do not believe a word he is saying or singing because it does not sound or feel authentic to me at all . A real singer is a kind of actor -- someone who draws you into an experience to move you . What Clay Aiken does is the vocal equivalent of putting varnish on a soulful unpainted wall . It is all show and no substance . Real singing is not about hitting notes , or belting out tunes , it is about really going deep into what makes the experience of being alive `` song '' worthy . He is the victim of everything wrong about celebrity and fame in this country . He is not an artist . Everybody likes him because everybody `` saw '' him ."}

This model uses the HP92A which holds 5ml of black ink for $ 20 . So if you buy 8 of the HP92 cartridges ( $ 160 worth ) you still do not have as much ink as the $ 30 HP42A cartridge . This works out to an extremely high cost per page.It also only uses a 5ml color cartridge .

Bryan constant reminder of adapting the asanas to your own body , and his emphasis of breathing are extremely valuable for someone who is still learning the ropes about yoga.The DVD editing , and the video quality can be improved , however . Sometimes I think due to trying to fit 3 sessions onto a single DVD , the editor had to cut some repetitions , making following the exact movement and breathing a bit difficult . This may have contributed some other users complaints about not having enough warm up . Video and audio quality are mediocre , especially the voice recording is not always the best , even metalic sometimes . With that said , it is a good value for having all 3 levels in one .

Having your own basket lets you practice your game as much as you want so you can correct problems with your game faster.It is a little on the heavy side , so if your need to carry it any real distance , I would recommend getting a small hand truck for it . It will definitely be worth it.If you are serious about your game , I would highly recommend this set ."}

This has stayed with me after reading the book , and I find that I am now drawn to Calcutta in the same way I was drawn to New England after reading H.P . Lovecraft , just to see if it is really that disturbing.The book is extremely enjoyable to read , with an almost literary quality . The author is deft at handling the demands of exposition within the constraints of the first person narration . A few moments ring untrue , but others ( including the climax ) are just fantastic . Overall the book has the messy feel of a true-life story , which of course makes it all the more disturbing.Highly recommended !"}

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEW 2010 BBR REISSUE INSTEAD.Special Things is a classic soul album from 1980 that was overlooked in the wake of the bigger , Poppier 80 s albums the group had its greatest success with . The vocals on this album are truly wonderful and this edition sounds great , looks amazing and has fantastic liner notes and interviews . For those who bought the disappointing Wounded Bird reissue three years ago , I say upgrade with confidence ! Bonus track Movin On has no vinyl crackling this time ! . A classy album portrayed at it is best.Beautiful in every way.I am so happy with this CD ! ! ! Ten out of five !"}

She makes it clear how she was attrracted to him and his movement and how she steadily got drawn further and further in . The story is incredibly compelling and does much to explain how these things happen . I too was part of a cult for many years and I recognized many of the characteristics that Layton identifies . She also does a great job of expressing how terrifying life became within this group , the suspense of her escape is intense .

The sudden quoting of scripture and the complete change in behavior is not what we see in new believers today . To portray a new believer in such a way , is to deceive seekers into thinking that as soon as you turn your life over to Christ , you will be a walking Bible , able to answer any question about the Lord that someone may ask you and that life will be great .

As it says in the Introduction , `` Discipline is Teaching '' This is the theme that runs through the book , and it is mentioned many times , but the book does not come out and hit you with it . I had to extract this most important general lesson through a lot of contemplation while reading.Many times throughout the book , I crossed out the word `` Discipline '' and wrote `` lesson '' or `` teaching '' and it makes much more sense that way.What are the lessons ? We are teaching children a system of fair rules and the positive and negative consequences for following them or not . This leads to self-control , self-regulation . Self-discipline is the goal of discipline.This book challenges us : '' To raise a morally developing , emotionally competent child will ultimately be more rewarding than simply an obedient one . ''"}

This reads very much like Jane Austen.However , considering content , this is more a Pride and Prejudice and Zombies affair , with various scenes of suppliant infants crawling in the dust and naked warriors chasing down horses .

As a result of both word choice and style , Zusak succeeds in very meticulously and subtly extracting emotion . Zusak brings Death voice out to add to the heaviness and numb reality of the book . Zusak manipulates emotion and words throughout the novel using a unique style and rhythm in his writing to place the reader in a powerfully susceptible position ."}

I recommend that you spend the extra money and get higher quality woven nylon netting ( similar to volleyball net ) , if you want to keep the deer out and spend your time in the garden and not fixing the fence . I am pretty sure this fence would keep out deer in about the 20-30 pound range , probably about the size of the deer indigenous to where this netting was manufactured . Save your money !"}

{"label": "2", "text": "I like this backpack and recommend it , however , I was surprised that the backpack is not as large as I thought it would be , but this has its advantages : ( 1 ) it is light ( of major importance to me ) , ( 2 ) it is less likely to catch on limbs or sticker weeds , ( 3 ) going under trees and heavy brush is easier . I like how the pockets on the side and in the back are protected and how the top bag is securely attached to the backpack ; also , I can attach my light sleeping bag and light tent to the backpack . For me as a hiker or prospector or detectorist , I could not find a better backpack ; it even has D rings on which I can attach a bungee cord that , on the other end attaches to the metal detector . The padding is adequate , not quite as heavy as an over $ 200 backpack , nor does it have a mesh for cooling the back ( I do not mind and the less weight the better ) . Overall , a great buy - well constructed , light , good price , and roomy enough for my needs ."}

For example , Testing of Loudspeakers - part of the book title - is barely 13 pages and is so basic as to not allow tuning of cabinet design . Rather this section focuses on determining specifications that speakers already come with . Suggestion of using PVC piping for ducts and asphalt paper for damping really remove any credibility for a successful high fidelity outcome using these techniques . Pictures of a hammer over a brad and a ruler on a woofer kind of tells it all . Many pages taken up with basic programming print outs - stuff that is available in Windows format free on the internet now .

On the surface , it is the tale of an Englishman venturing into the `` depths '' of the Congo , the separation of `` civilized '' European lifestyle growing as the principal character travels deeper and deeper into `` primitive '' Africa.The cultural comparisons and ethical and moral issues the book raises are why the book is regarded as a classic - no answers are given , rather the reader is invited to determine who is the more civilized - the greedy and pugnatious colonists , or the half-clad Africans.The imagery vivid , although I found the writing itself to be a bit hard to follow - the monologue of the narrator and principal character , Marlowe can be a bit difficult to follow - hence the 4 stars . A worthwhile read if only to wrestle with the issue of civility and morality ."}

I hardly use it , because I do not have to.I inflate my bike tires ( once a year and maybe during the winter I add some psi to one of our cars tires . There are four bolts that hold the electric motor and the little compressor together ( I think ) . They get loose and they fall of - one at a time . The problem is that there very hard to screw back , without taking the plastic enclosur apart - another tough part right there . I imagine if they only added a star washer or a drop of that gung that holds the bolts in place , the problem would go away for the grand expense of 2 cents total - if that ! ! The plastic silver cover is another joke - no , it does not transfer any heat and it is NOT bolted on . The four bolts are for decoration only ! I did expected better for $ 65+ , but it looks it is heading to the scrap yard before the next winter rolls in ( 2010 ) ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "It took me just two days -- with guiding for trout in between -- to finish this great book . Mr. Samson pen is just amazing . It not only describes permit flyfishing , but also the magic that surrounds it , among destinations , techniques , flies , fly tying , history , guides , habitat , fish behavior , unrevealed secrets , and much , much more . His words `` It takes a certain type of flyfisherman to fish for permit : It takes one who does not mind not catching fish . It takes a saltwater fly rodder who can spend days , weeks and months on the flats in the broiling sun and whipping wind -- with very little chance of reward '' , reveal the essence of permit flyfishing . This is a book that should be read by every flyfisherman ; not only saltwater flyfishermen . It shows the passion hidden behind every flyfishermen in search of the ultimate challenge .

He show how the Third Republic came into being , its numerous internal struggles , and its imperial quest for a world empire . He shows how the French army stood against the Germans in World War 1 and how it contributed to the allied powers victory .

Definitely not a read , for those looking for spiritual help to solve their problems . Ansay rejects religion as an option and instead flies by the seat of her pants with helpful or well meaning cliches . `` When God shuts a door , he opens a window '' This particular saying took her the best part of `` Limbo '' to come to terms with and finally embrace.The author indeed lost the life she loved , and was turn in another direction . She has determination , a support team , and love throughout her battle , which still is a daily effort.I would not recommend this book to a friend ."}

Moreover , the backstory involving the reason for her isnomnia is completely unconvincing as none of it is reflected in her character.I simply found the romance ludicrious and rather disturbing in its conclusion .

It has all the good ingredients ; suspense , action , horror , comedy and I agree with most of the reviewers an excellent sound track that makes the movie even eerier ! ! I do not understand why such a great movie did not make it in the Box Office ... it seems that nowadays to make it , it must have matrix-like effects !

It is also a moral story ( in a way that Harry Potter has never been ) about our infinite capacity to do evil without meaning to , and the terrifying responsibility that doing so entails to try to right things . Harry might suffer the usual case of teenaged angst , but Lewis really has done a terrible thing , out of questionable motives , and his guilt and misery really resonate with children who know that they have the potential to do the same . And yet he prevails , in the face of real terror . Give it a try ; Bellairs is good and Gorey illustrations are classic ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "This book by Dennis Smith is a fine prequel to his Engine Co. 82 . In 82 we saw a young man dealing with the job he has chosen for himself , and a difficult job that was . In Song for Mary we see the boy who became that man . The only way a man could become a fireman is if he had great compassion for humanity . Mary , his mother , gave him this compassion . The `` Song '' of the title resonates throughout the book with the haunting refrain of The Rose of Tralee . I thought this memoir was as good , if not better , than those of Frank McCourt and others which have filled the bookshops recently . A MUST-READ for anyone who cherishes their Irish-American heritage or if they came of age in New York City ,"}

Around 5 classic songs are excellently sung by Chente in the film , and the character portrayed by Vicente does leave one inspired . Ending is rather tragic , but well worth the overall movie line .

The characters are so well drawn that you will come to know them well in only a few pages and you will CARE about them . You will also care about the painting , so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind . When you finish the book , you will turn back to page one and start again . One of the best books ever , and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce ."}

It takes decent video , if you put it on a tripod . The built-in stabilization is worthless in video mode and you will get a palsy type shaking no matter what you do . In other words , this will not replace your camcorder . In picture mode , it does a good job with most outdoors or indoors settings if you are not too picky about the lens distortions around the corners at the highest resolution . This is especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near the left or right edges of the frame ( like stop signs , light posts , building edge lines etc . ) All in all , a decent buy for home use . Not something to look into if you will be frequently printing your pictures for posterity or for use in professional publications ."}

The last movie I experienced like that was `` Schindler List '' .Kramer vs. Kramer is a must-see movie . I will admit it loses a little bit on the smaller TV screen ( just about all movies do ) . If possible , view it on a large screen TV ( at least 34 '' ) and pump the audio through hi-fi speakers or headphones . If you are under 40 , the movie may seem a bit dated to you but the basic emotions will touch you deeply .

However , I still highly recommend it based solely on Andras Schiff beautiful playing . I have had this compilation sitting on my shelves for over a year and finally had a chance to listen to it a few days ago ; despite the recording flaws , Schiff playing is majestic , poetic , demonstrating his empathy for Schubert music . Both sets of Impromptus are played with ample dignity and grace ; the same holds true for the Landler ( waltzes ) and Moments Musicaux . It is a pity that Decca usually high fidelity standards were not in evidence here , or else I would say that this two CD set would deserve recognition as among the finest recordings of these Schubert pieces currently available ."}

The author preferred to focus on the tribulations of a couple of characters , caming back to the main topic now and again and always marginally .

Yes , at one point you almost find yourself sympathizing with mr Nortons character , but then you realize what he is doing and you feel disgusted and are glad when he changes and once again becomes human.The most scary part of the movie is , when you realize that these kind of people are really out there , amongst all of us ...

{"label": "2", "text": "The first solo album by Supertramp Roger Hodgson , is perhaps my favorite album in a collection of over 600 disks . The 7 songs cover a wide range of styles , from the Pink Floydish `` Had a Dream ( Sleeping with the Enemy ) to the light `` In Jeopardy '' which sounds most like a Supertramp song , to the beautiful and haunting `` Only Because of You '' . I bought this record when it first came out , then spent years trying to find a copy on CD and am very glad to see that it is available again . The music is amazing , but after looking at the personn el and find only a few people on a few songs , it was astounding to see that Roger did this almost by himself . If you like it , look high and low for the follow up `` Hai Hai '' ."}

I have shown this true life story to my high school students , and it has brought tears to their eyes and an inkling of what lessons one can learn through experiecing even death -- especially , such a devastating one as ALS . There were some changes in the movie of some aspects of the book TUESDAYS with MORRIE , which is all the more reason to read the book as well which is totally factual . The ABC documentary of Ted Koppel interviews with Morrie and the author -- Mitch Ablom -- is a perfect followup to the movie -- -extremely insightful , showing the reality of death , disease , and most of all , love and hope ! The Lessons of Life -- ABC Ted Koppel three interviews with Morrie as the disease progressed throughout his body but not his spirit -- - are inspirational and touching ! !"}

The reviews noting the thickness are spot on - there is a large battery bulge in the bottom , but it is not too unwieldy . One of the nice features is that there are not too many physical buttons . This gives it a clean look , but the most often accessed buttons should be the physical ones . Sony missed an obvious design issue here - the numeric buttons should have been made physical . They are present in almost every function and by moving these often repeated buttons to physical keys it would free up 10 extra LCD keys for more advanced programming . Maybe Sony is listening and we will see a revised model soon ... Overall one of the best universal remotes and it is definitely the least expensive of the LCD I have run across - by 50 % or more ."}

Zeidner prose is uninspiring at its best , and borders on the pretentious at its worst .

The plot is prototypical -- do not be fooled by the fact that Claire is a mathematician -- Zeidner gets no more original than that . Women readers may be offended , especially those who have lost a child , by Zeidner completely inept portrayl of a grieving mother -- why Claire would view this event ( and four years after the fact , at that ! ) as reason to go to bed with everything in sight boggles the mind . Zeidner has written a particularly awful scene involving over-40 sex in a backyard -- again , very original .

It is no longer the intelligent angst of Opiate and parts of Undertow ( I say intelligent because Limp Bizkit is unintelligent angst , it is important to know the difference ) . It is no longer the minor stab into the occult , into ideas , into sound scapes that Aenima was . Lateralus has the influence of high electronic music . Maynard has said he listens to Autechre often , and their influence shows . The songs are harder to listen to at first , like the Rolling Stone review said , but it demands three listenings initially at least . Then it owns you . Tool have matured over five years and they think we have too . The music is stronger , more fierce and soft all at once . The range is greater and the ideas are better than those presented on previous albums ."}

Aside from the general excellence of acting and photography , and the fidelity to history , one can not forget the haunting , wordless picture of Cardinale when she sees again the form of a man she might have loved . The whole film has that aura - dreamlike , memory-nudging , self-reproaching , the over riding sense of regret that a brilliant screen writer has fashioned in a wholly unexpected presentation . The story of Nobile is given a treatment that one wishes had been adapted by the film makers to the equally tragic story of Scott , his wife @ his stalwart comrades . This film is better than `` The Last Place on Earth '' , a famous Scott saga , because of its originality , poetry and profound sense of authentic tragedy . Not just another adventure film , its characters as ghosts prove to be the best way to tell it is true story ."}

Guess the powers that be would rather not have people read Matthew 18:11 , 17:21 , 23:14 , Acts 7:37 or other verses that are ENTIRELY OMITTED or significantly shortened ( i.e . Luke 9:55-56 ) from most later versions of Bibles , so that you lose the powerful statements that were given to us by God . Better stock some printed King James Version Bibles and a few of these Concordances ...

( The author is compared to Paul Bowles -- I strongly disagree . ) The characters are cardboard-y , never fleshed out . Though I wanted to , I did not care at all about them . The exotic location and dissoltion of the marriage could have made this a wonderfully menacing tale , but the natives are complete cliches and the couple themselves are silly and irritating . The daughter is an interesting , good character ( the best passages involve her ) -- yet she , too , is stuck in cliches and seems more of a symbol than a person . The spare style of the writing does not help here -- instead of making the story clear and powerful , it just leaves you saying. `` So what ?

It is as easy as described to use and clean .

{"label": "2", "text": "This recording works fine for what it is , just a fun tribute that is not meant to equal or surpass the original recordings . It is a great band covering some of their favorite Robert Johnson songs sometimes sticking close to the original arrangements and sometimes not . It is not all about Clapton and that will leave some fans disappointed but it does feature tight , controlled ensemble playing that is reminiscent of the early Muddy Waters bands of the fifties . Another reviewer cited Jimmy Rogers classic album Chicago Bound as an example and Muddy Waters Sings Big Bill Broonzy also comes to mind . One also needs to keep in mind that this is an album of covers and as such it is unrealistic to expect it to sound as deep or as haunted as the original work . Ask yourself whether anyone has done a version of Layla that is as tormented as the original and then buy this CD for what it is , just a solid blues album that was meant to pay tribute to Mr. Johnson not compete with him ."}

There was the main plot element in the book : `` the footage '' which again , never really went anywhere . In the end , the producers of the footage are found , and there is no point to any of it other than the fact that some people where making it and Cayce found them .

{"label": "2", "text": "For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster , The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter . My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor , disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good . In fact , though , the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth , the acting and pacing is excellent , and while there is some sentimental nonsense , it restrains itself more than most films do these days . The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography , the way that deaths of important characters are treated , and some of the images which arouse real pathos.It is still nothing spectacular , though - it never really risks saying anything that has not been said before , or presenting some image which has not been seen before - but it is probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience ."}

Most of the film takes place in a hospital or at the characters homes . The screenplay is much more interested in introducing a lot of characters to you rather than fleshing any of them out .

{"label": "1", "text": "I bought this model and found it quite disappointing after my experience with the mini version -- if you like to brew with the freshest water , prefer greater control over cup sizes , and want a model that does not take up a ridiculous amount of room , go with the mini . With the B40 , the reservoir system just means you almost always have water standing in the unit . It only has two cup sizes , both of which are kind of odd for modern mugs ( and which do not seem optimized for the lighter roasts ) . While it says in the specs that the size is 12.8 x 15.1 x 15.2 inches , you need at least another four inches of vertical clearance to get the thing open ! Also , since it has a pump , it vibrates and is noisier . I wholeheartedly endorse the mini , but the only thing the B40 Elite has going for it is you can fit a travel mug under it.It works , it makes coffee , so I ca not say it is horrible ... just very disappointing ."}

I do not think he pulled it off however , although the idea of the book is an interesting one .

Maria-Teresa true blue collar nature did work wonderfully , in my view , with Renne unending criticisim of himself . In my opinion The Soloist needs some poigant and touching moments to make it realistic . His lack of communication with others seems amazingly overplayed . The only hope throughout the entire book in my mind comes from his interest with Smokey vet . This makes him seem human and a man with feeling . In my recomendation this is not a book I would suggest to the reader looking for light , airy , and pleasent reading ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "I also think that this book is too full of academic theory and techniques , and this may be the reason it comes off as so cynical . It works best in providing factual background that would be difficult to find otherwise . But when the book shades into critique , the tone becomes dry and pre-occupied , if not positively dispiriting - particularly when the co-authors subject Tarkovsky to their brand of Freudian analysis . The result is a disjointed collection of facts and vexing speculations , which on balance does a disservice to the poetry of the films . I personally much prefer Maya Turovskaya book , which does not have the encyclopedic range of facts one finds in `` Fugue '' ( a friend of mine described `` Fugue '' method as `` trainspotting '' ) but is a far more inspired and illuminating combination of intelligent insight and love of its subject ."}

This would include Maroon 5 , Billy Talent , and Clap Your Hands Say Yea .

I can listen to their cd over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track . While anything can become irritating , it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me . I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys , but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me . I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown . Very good , upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home ."}

The story never faulters , always flows , always keeps you wondering . The characters start out as hippies -- a group -- and then become individuals who you come to know . They are a bunch of young kids striving for ideals , but of course are like all of human kind , with weaknesses , foibles , strengths , unique backgrounds , and passions . It is the messes we get into that make for good tales . I have lived in the Southwest and Alaska both , and I love sense of place in stories , so this book was a delicious treat in this way , as well .

It has great photographs throughout and is straight and to the point about the origins and history of Vodou from West Africa all the way up to the present day without information overload.I have been a practioner of `` The Arts '' for many years , as well as a historian and there is not one negative thing I can say about this book .

There are huge differences between the races and how each race responds to lines such as , `` Girl you so fine '' , that line would get no lady to be interested in a man in many races . The men presented are so sleezy and corny , that it is a wonder that they are regarded as players by the author . Since when is cool to call a girl straight after seeing her ?

It is very `` Goddess '' centered , which is nice I am sure for feminists , but the Celts were Polytheistic with male AND female dieties , not to mention other spiritual beings which the author lumps together as `` fairies '' ( another inaccuracy ) . There are plenty of decent books on Celtic Women Studies , from authors like PB Ellis , Miranda Green , Jean Markale , to mention a few . Look there instead of here !"}

The new album is very polished , containing heavy tracks , as well as some softer slower melodic tracks . Sevendust have come a long way with their sound since their original self-titled cd . Definately 5 stars , best album yet ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "The book Hoot is a very interesting book . It is really funny and random . The genre is mostly comedy and mystery . It is the funniest book I ever read . I really like Roy , the main charecter . He is very odd butfunny . Dana Marthston is the big bully looking for fresh meat.Roy is a 7th grader who just moved from Montana to Florida . When Dana Marthston is shoving his head in the bus window , he sees a boy running with no shoes . He tries to chase him but gets hit by a golfball . His father works for the govorment so if Roy told him he would report it"}

{"label": "1", "text": "First of all , this will be a great almanac for you if you are focusing only on US studies . This book contains everything from main events to average teacher salaries , and many other useful ( and weird ) facts of the united states . However , when i tried to look up information on India and Argentina , it contains very few information . I will guess that 97 % of the book focuses only on America and have minor out-of-date information on other countries . Two stars is for the indepth info on united states , and the missing three stars are for naming the book `` world '' almanac even though it does not focus on the world . May as well be the United States Almanac for the hunnger-for-weird-facts ."}

{"label": "2", "text": "One of the delightful results of Natalie Cole smash album `` Unforgettable '' was the renewed interest in her father legendary recorded work . This was part of the result , an near-perfect collection of the ballads and finger-popping swingers that made Nat Cole reputation as one of the greatest pop singers of all time ( unfortunately , the second-best on his own label ) . I left out one star because Nat last hit , `` L-O-V-E '' is not included , nor is the `` Christmas Song '' the sweet `` That Sunday , That Summer , '' or the last , best rendition of `` Nature Boy .

{"label": "1", "text": "When my daughter turned eighteen her doctor recommended her to get on a blue-green algae supplement to develop a healthy foundation . Source Naturals seemed to be on the top of the list here , so I bought a bottle . The benefits as described are great , but when my daughter opened the bottle and placed one in her mouth , she gagged . I smelled the bottle and it smelled fishy and putrid . I thought it was a bad batch , but after returning and receiving another one , it had the same odor . I was also disappointed at the fact that the label read 500MG but was referring to two tablets - so they are only 250mg each.If you can get past the unappetizing smell and pop it in your mouth , this product is fine . My daughter ca not , so I bought herthis Blue-green Algaefor around the same price . It provides the same benefits without the terrible odor and my daughter has been taking it for four weeks now , no problem ."}
{"label": "2", "text": "This touching film speaks to the irrational ties of familial loyalty that even a lifetime of hurt wo not extinguish . With warmth and subtlety , it details how the younger generation of women protect the health and well-being of the eldest through the kindest of deceptions . Though consumed by long-simmering resentment over Eka favoritism toward her only son , Marina still makes an unselfish choice to shield Eka from hurt . `` Otar '' is a life-affirming gem , with all three actresses superb in the central roles , particularly Gorintin , who broke my heart as Eka ."}
{"label": "1", "text": "The problem I see with this book is that it makes a sweeping generalization of all school shooters based on one case , Kip Kinkel , who suffers from mental illness . In contrast , other school shootings appear to be the result of bullying and a sense of helplessness by kids that before being bullied appeared to have been fairly normal children . What is pushing these children over the edge that results in the heartbreaking decision to seek retribution by violence ? What is happening in our society and what do we do about it ?"}
{"label": "2", "text": "This is a wonderful story that belongs on your bookshelf ( after having read it several times , of course ) . My Mom recommended it to me a few years ago , and I read it in a single sitting . The story is gripping , heartwarming , and inspiring all at once . James McBride tells the true story of his Polish mom and African American dad , alternating every chapter between his mom perspective and his own . In an age of commercialized , pre-packaged , and shrink-wrapped Chicken Soup around every corner , a ( true ! ) story like `` The Color of Water '' is a must-read . Definitely check it out ."}

{"label": "1", "text": "What a dog . Germans may be able to make cars but not movies . Fortunately this was just a free blockbuster rental . Why the low rating ? Basic plot line- Good girl running from bad people or one bad person who refuses to stay dead . Spoiler Alert : It seems like 90 % of the movie is her hiking up one sand dune and down the other . Last 5 minutes of the film , girl chooses to end her life so the universe can collapse in on itself and start again . No plot , No acting , No good CGA either . The other 2 reviewers must have been snoozing to give it 5 stars . Instead of wasting your time and money on this movie visit kiva org and provide a small micro-loan to a 3rd world needy someone . : - )"}
