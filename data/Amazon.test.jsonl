While the author offers ( and repeats , and repeats ) considerable anecdotal evidence for animal emotion , there is little concrete science to support the claims.Furthermore , the field of emotion-cognition study in humans is still coming into its own and has grown exponentially since 1996 . Indeed , we now understand many human emotions better than in 1996 . Naturally , when comparing humans and animal emotions , these advances dramatically change our understanding and therefore draw into question many of the inferences made in the book.Not a great book to begin with . However , a decade after its release , it is borderline useless ."}

The problem is that most of these devices are next to impossible to wear with shoes on because they are bulky and the bands pinch inside shoes .

I also enjoyed reading Mary Helen Lagasse article which describes her childhood in the Irish channel . Mary Helen and I are friends since my second stay at Tulane , 1971-1976 . Of course , I read the other articles as well , and they all are designed to describe New Orleans as it was before the destruction , and what it should become again ."}

I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers . One Second is different from Yello other albums and , in my opinion , does not hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno . While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there ( and brilliantly done ) , the sound is less annalog and has more feel . It is not background music , but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed . The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey style and voice . In my mind , this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere . It is different , but it is very very good !"}

The main feature of this work is Cantor inability to prove any of his assertions . Instead of resting on solid arguments and dealing with the core beliefs of the historians he attempts to critique , he rests upon immature insults and a bizarre , ineffective attempt at providing an historical context to their works . Cantor displays more of his own biases , from his individual center , right wing version of history to his repetitive complaints about the homosexuality of various historians . Cantor work fails to provide the historical context , the historical tradition or explain the vivid historiography of medieval writings . Above all else , this book is uninteresting , uninformed , and intensely monotonous . I am highly skeptical of the selection process by which Cantor adjudges the who who of medieval historians ."}

Never mind that Mr. Carnegie was a Scottish immigrent whose father was a weaver and came to America looking for opportunity for his family while TR was born to wealth and privilege . Carnegie starting as a clerk for a railroad co. took great risks of his own capital to build the steel industry one of the most important building blocks of prosperity and ultimatly returned his great wealth to society .

I already had an okay older VHF or UHF combo and a channelmaster 777 pre amp . Worked great UNTIL the digital `` improvement '' . Then we lost any of the channels that were broadcasting on the UHF frequencies . I put up this antenna aimed it and voila ! , we had our missing channels . Dang ! It provides excellent reception on transmitters providing better then minimal power and does quite well even on the minimal power ones but those will fade in and out at times . Oh I forgot to say , we live around 70 miles away from the transmitters as the crow flies . Plan on some time to assemble ."}

Obviously the script was written by either a teenage boy or some other loser who believes that all adults are complete morons ! Still , there is something to be said about this twisted belief .

Giancarlo Esposito ( one of filmdom less appealing actors ) plays some kind of scientist who finds a mythical beast called the Chupacabra , and smuggles it on board a luxury liner . Of course , some goofus deckhands release the creature and it starts eating up both crew and passengers . John Rhys Davies ( shame on you , John , for taking on such roles ) plays the ship captain who also has his naively innocent daughter on board , and we get Dylan Neal as a handsome US Marshal to help fight the monster .

Her swinging `` Day In Day Out '' is one of the best ever and her `` Blame it on My Youth '' is simply the best rendition ever of that standard . While her vocal range has narrowed with age , her musical instincts on this album are on target . This is album is a must for all lovers of jazz vocals ."}

The remix of Homies is dissapointing , but how can you possibly improve that song ? Overall , the Cd is worth buying just for the Hallowicked collection alone . I would recommend the cd but there are some songs on here that are rather ... well ... dumb . Now I have been listening to ICP since the release of riddlebox and love most of what they have done except Hells Pit ( terrible album ) , but some things are just to juvenile and dumb , even for ICP .

A cheap external microphone helps the sound quality considerably , and eliminates the handling noise ( which can be severe ) .The software that comes with this device is absolutely essential . It is a primitive-looking application , and I would not dream of using it for any serious sound engineering , but it does the one thing it really needs to do : decrypts the oddball , proprietary Olympus DSS codec into something usable . For Mac users , it is also important that it decrypts the WMV format ( used for the high-fidelity settings ) into AIFF . Otherwise , you would be stuck with Windows Media Player files , which are limited on any platform and practically useless on a Mac.Note to Olympus : open standards are the way of the future .

I knew they were basically kid books , but it was Pratchett writing , so how could they be bad ? Well folks , I guess anything is possible , even that Pratchett could trip up once in a while . These books all tread flatly into the land of hard-to-go-with-it , a tough order when you have swallowed all the Discworld books whole . The characters are either twee or overdone to the point of yawn . The humour , watered down apparently for children , comes off as stale , there is little logic involved in the plots , and I got really , really sick of Tiffany .

The writing is rough , even amateurish , and the story lines of the pieces are often trite and stock . But in spite of the general weakness of the writings , there are thematic elements and character types in the pieces that would reappear in Faulkner mature writings . What is absolutely amazing is that just two years after the publication of these mediocre writings , Faulkner had published two novels and was deeply involved in the creation of his masterpiece , _The Sound and the Fury_ ."}

Sadly the clip becomes easily dislodged and the arm strap gets in the way . This is no design fault just basic practicality .

'' It is a nearly verbatim retelling of his stage play `` Valentine Day , '' and the sets and costumes beautifully transport the viewer back to the days of homefront World War I. Foote central characters , newlyweds Horace and Elizabeth Robideaux , are acted with what might be termed `` British '' sensitivity ( high praise ! ) , and even his subsidiary characters are fascinating -- particularly Uncle George and Cousin Bobby . Though leisurely ( some might say `` stagy '' ) in director Ken Harrison affectionate realization , `` On Valentine Day '' remains a gripping narrative . In the context of the filmed trilogy , it becomes much more : a shattering experience peopled by some of Horton Foote most indelible characters ."}

No longer can you play head to head with someone until one of you builds up enough blocks to `` die '' , instead you can only play as long as you want in story mode , which is one player . In the multiplayer mode , you ca not play a long , involved game against someone . Instead , you play a game that has a time limit , and goals . This would be ok if you could turn the time limit on and off , and if you could manually adjust the goals . Since you can do neither , this [ is bad ] .My fiance asked how could someone [ mess ] up Tetris , and this is the answer , this game . The N64 version is a much better game.This game is only good if you are someone who likes short little games in multiplayer .

Another problem is that his piano is tuned to a rich Romantic tone which is not conducive to Mozart , and which contributes his lack of command .

{"label": "1", "text": "It is the most STABLE floor lamp , most BENDABLE head , MOST bright AND Grandrich EZ Reader 27 watt floor lamp gives an opportunity to FORGIVE and practice PATIENCE . It often does not turn on until unplugged , replugged and turned on and off . Ordering new bullb gave same results . Grandrich Corp went out of business in Jan 2012 but there are still plenty of their floor lamps for sale . You can see why after reading the other reviews . Called Grandrich Corp , Light Spectrum Enterprises ( who mailed replacement bulb sep 2012 ) and Lamps USA ( who shipped original lamp in Oct2011 ) and the 2 year warranty did not work . Amazon is superb and has great customer relations . Do recommend keeping an ORDERS file folder with comments on each item ordered . Hope you will be happy with this floor lamp . Buy it as cheaply as you can . The bulbs are ok . I am happy with with AMAZON and the bulbs and lamp . Where else do you get so much opportunity to love your neighbor ?"}
